Deploying this Partner Solution for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with default parameters builds the following CloudBees CI environment in the AWS Cloud.

![Partner Solution architecture for CloudBees CI on AWS](https://d1.awsstatic.com/partner-network/QuickStart/datasheets/cloudbees-core-architecture-on-aws.f458a95880735d9329884e9ea2673c85a56abd9b.png)

As shown in <<Figure 1>>, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with three public and three private subnets (one public and one 
private subnet in each Availability Zone).*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group, to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to the Amazon EKS nodes in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, the following Amazon EKS nodes in Auto Scaling groups:
** Three CloudBees CI master nodes.
** Three CloudBees CI regular agent nodes.
** Three CloudBees CI Spot agent nodes. These nodes are in an Auto Scaling group that is configured for multiple instance types.
* Helm and kubectl installed and configured on the bastion host.
* CloudBees CI installed on Amazon EKS as a Kubernetes StatefulSet.
* An Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system and efs-provisioner for 
Multi-AZ file storage. You can configure the Quick Start to use Amazon Elastic Block 
Store (Amazon EBS) instead of Amazon EFS. For more information, see the Data 
storage options section.

> **Note**
> *The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
