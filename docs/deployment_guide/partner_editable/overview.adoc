This guide covers the information you need to deploy the CloudBees CI Partner Solution in the AWS Cloud.

# Overview
https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/[CloudBees CI^] offers a modern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
solution based on the Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Jenkins. Available on AWS, CloudBees CI can run and scale on Kubernetes platforms, like https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service^] (Amazon EKS). CloudBees CI includes Operations Center, which enables administrators to quickly provision Managed Controllers for each development team. Each Managed Controller has the https://docs.cloudbees.com/plugins/ci/kubernetes[Kubernetes plugin^] pre-installed, so it can use Kubernetes to launch agent pods that run CI/CD workloads.

This Partner Solution provides a turnkey installation of CloudBees CI on Amazon EKS and demonstrates architectural best practices like automatic scaling, segregation of agent workloads, and more. The deployment divides the Amazon EKS cluster into two partitions:

- The first partition runs Operations Center and Managed Controllers on EC2 on-demand instances.
- The second partition runs regular agents on EC2 on-demand instances.

Each partition resides in its own https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^] group to scale independently of 
other partitions.

> **Note**
> For advanced use cases with the intent on testing spiky workloads, a third partition can be provisioned to run Spot agents on EC2 Spot instances. The Spot partition uses an https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-auto-scaling-groups-with-multiple-instance-types-purchase-options/[Auto Scaling group with multiple instance types^] to support a more diversified Spot fleet, which increases Spot Instance availability and uptime. Although Spot Instance requests are not guaranteed and in-use Spot Instances may be reclaimed abruptly, running certain CI/CD workloads on Spot Instances can save up to 50â€“90 percent on compute costs.

> **Note**
> This reference deployment uses the https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-amazon-eks/#_overview[Amazon EKS Partner Solution^] as a foundation to provide a fully managed, highly available, and certified Kubernetes-conformant control plane for CloudBees CI.

Please know that we may share who uses AWS Partner Solutions with the AWS Partner Network 
(APN) Partner that collaborated with AWS on the content of the Partner Solution.

## CloudBees CI on AWS
After you deploy this Partner Solution, you can integrate CloudBees CI more deeply with AWS by 
using plugins. For more information, search for AWS and Amazon in the https://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugins Index^]. For CloudBees CI examples, refer to the **Getting started with CloudBees CI** section in this guide.
