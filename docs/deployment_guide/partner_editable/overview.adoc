# Overview
CloudBees CI offers a modern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
solution based on Jenkins. Available on AWS, CloudBees CI can run and scale on Kubernetes platforms, like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). CloudBees CI includes Operations Center, which enables administrators to quickly provision Managed Controllers for each development team. Each Managed Controller has the Kubernetes plugin pre-installed, so it can use Kubernetes to launch agent pods that run CI/CD workloads.

This Quick Start provides a turnkey installation of CloudBees CI on Amazon EKS and demonstrates architectural best practices like automatic scaling, segregation of agent workloads, and Kubernetes-native integration with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances. This integration is achieved by dividing the Amazon EKS cluster into three partitions:

- The first partition runs Operations Center and Managed Controllers on EC2 on-demand 
instances.
- The second partition runs regular agents on EC2 on-demand instances.
- The third partition runs Spot agents on EC2 Spot Instances.

Each partition resides in its own Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to scale independently of 
other partitions. The Spot partition uses an Auto Scaling group with multiple instance types
to support a more diversified Spot fleet, which increases Spot Instance availability and uptime. Although Spot Instance requests are not guaranteed and in-use Spot Instances may be reclaimed abruptly, running certain CI/CD workloads on Spot Instances can save up to 50â€“90 percent on compute costs.
> **Note**
> Note: This reference deployment uses the Amazon EKS Quick Start as a foundation 
to provide a fully managed, highly available, and certified Kubernetes-conformant
control plane for CloudBees CI.

Please know that we may share who uses AWS Quick Starts with the AWS Partner Network 
(APN) Partner that collaborated with AWS on the content of the Quick Start.

## CloudBees CI on AWS
After you deploy this Quick Start, you can integrate CloudBees CI more deeply with AWS by 
using plugins. For more information, search for AWS and Amazon in the Jenkins Plugins Index. For CloudBees CI examples, refer to the Getting started with CloudBees CI section in this guide.

## Cost and licenses
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start 
reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using the Quick Start.
The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes customizable configuration parameters. Some of these settings, such as instance type, affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you use. Prices are subject to change.
**Note**
> Tip: After you deploy the Quick Start, enable the AWS Cost and Usage Report to 
track costs associated with the Quick Start. This report delivers billing metrics to an 
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your account and provides 
cost estimates based on usage throughout each month and finalizes the data at the 
end of the month. For more information, see the AWS documentation.

After you deploy the Quick Start, you can request a free, 15-day trial license for CloudBees 
by choosing Request a trial license in the CloudBees CI Cloud Operations Center. For 
purchasing information, submit a pricing request through the CloudBees website.
