# Deployment Options

This Partner Solution provides two deployment options:

- **Deploy CloudBees CI into a new VPC** (end-to-end deployment). This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. CloudBees CI is then deployed into this new VPC.

- **Deploy CloudBees CI into an existing VPC**. This option provisions CloudBees CI
in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Partner Solution templates also let you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) 
blocks, instance types, the initial number of managed controller and agent nodes, and volume sizes, as 
discussed in **step 2** of the deployment steps.
