# Troubleshooting

**Question:** I encountered a **CREATE_FAILED** error when I launched the {partner-product-name}.::
**Answer:** If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with **Rollback on failure** set to **Disabled**. (This setting is under **Advanced** in the AWS CloudFormation console, **Options** page.) With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained and the instance remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in 
`%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)

IMPORTANT: When you set Rollback on failure to Disabled, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Ensure to delete the stack when you finish
troubleshooting.

**Question:** I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.::
**Answer:** Launch the {partner-product-name} templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the AWS documentation.

**Question:** I encountered Permission denied when I ran `ssh ec2-user@kube.worker.ip.addr` on the bastion host.::
**Answer:** Kubernetes agent workers are accessed using the key pair that you created in your account before you deployed the {partner-product-name}. Use SSH agent forwarding to pass your key to the bastion host when you log in, so that it can be used later to access Kubernetes agent workers.

On your local terminal, create or edit your `~/.ssh/config` file so that it looks like the following, using your own bastion IP address:
----
Host cb-core-quickstart-bastion
 HostName 3.94.157.213
 ForwardAgent yes
----
Then add your key into the SSH authentication agent by using `ssh-add ~/path/to/key.pem`.
Finally, log in to the bastion host with `ssh -A ec2-user@bastion.host.ip.addr`.
